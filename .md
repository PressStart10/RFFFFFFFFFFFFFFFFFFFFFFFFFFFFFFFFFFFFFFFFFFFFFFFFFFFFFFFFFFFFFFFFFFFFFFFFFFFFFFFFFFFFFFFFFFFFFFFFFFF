## My Website
  My website is located [here](http://clickallthebuttons.space/),I made it by myself.
## html5
  it's a cool language, and my blog is made with it but... I do use other resources.
## JavaScript
  with html comes JavaScript, while not the easiest, it gets the job done quite well.
## jQuery(`general`)
  now... along with JavaScript, you have jQuery. jQuery is a js(JavaScript) library, using commands like:
  $("#bla").html("bla"). to relapse: document.getElementById("bla").innerHTML="bla"
## sftp
  OK; lets talk about how I update my blog, in command prompt I put `sftp bla@bla-data.host`. then I enter my password and; voilÃ ! I'm in the __sftp__ screen, before the line input is `sftp>`. then I remove script.js and add everything again.
## jQuery (`attaching to your JavaScript`)
  well; it's very simple, you just put ``<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>`` in your head tag. ya,simple right?
## W3schools/stack overflow
  [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp), a reliable resource, is well reliable. I actually learned jQuery from it, [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also good; but I don't recommend it, for me, I don't relay use stack overflow, it's not as good as W3schools.
___welp, that's all I got for ye'___
